# DATA-Compression
Data compression is the process of modifying, encoding or converting the bits structure of data in such a way that it consumes less space on disk. It enables reducing the storage size of one or more data instances or elements. Data compression is also known as source coding or bit-rate reduction.
In this project i have implemented text and image compression using Python Programming language 
For text data compression I have used <b>Huffman coding</b> which is lossless type of data compersion.you can find this code in huff.py
For Image compersion I have used pillow's inbulit function and filter which acts as lossy data comperssion u can find this code in img.py
To make is easier for user I have implemented GUI using pyqt5
<b>One of the main feature of this Project is you can use it to compress multiple text files or multiple images easily<b>


<b>Basic requirement to run this project are</b><br>
1.<i> Python 3.5 or higher</i><br>
2.<i> Must Have PIL and Pyqt5 package installed</i><br>
3.<i> Any Python IDE</i><br>


<b>To run this Project do the following steps</b></br>
1.<i> Clone or download the files</i><br>
2.<i> After downloading extract all the files to one folder ,if u have cloned then u can skip this step</i><br>
3.<i> Open the project folder with any python IDE and the find file named app.py</i><br>
4.<i> After finding it open it and run it <b>before runing make sure all the basic requirements are fullfield</b></i><br><br>

**Note : While compressing single image file you will be asked for the quality of the image .While giving this quality don't excced more than width of you device as you compress output image is displayed through message box if u exceed your device width then you may not find ok button as it whould be out of your display**
